# AKExtensionsAUHost
AudioUnit Extension AUHost Project using AudioKit 

This is a mod of Apple's AUExtension host app, with an example of how to build a super simple AUv3 Synth using AudioKit libraries.

Basically you can use it as a base project to build AU Extensions, and test in realtime with MIDI input.

Plus the AUv3Host has been modified so you can use a realtime MIDI input.

Thanks to Gene De Lisa for his MIDIManager.
Aure, Colin and the rest of the AudioKit team.
